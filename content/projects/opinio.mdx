Founded a B2B SaaS platform 'Opinio' from a Hackathon concept, an automated retrieval and analysis platform for company reviews across several sources. Built the Full Stack using modern technologies and implemented sentiment analysis pipeline for review data, grouping and categorizing them using Cosine similarity on Vector Embeddings.
